      based on the total stars in there account and the total number of players in the Zine cards game. For example, if
      there are 16 players, the top four players (based on the stars) will be in platinum, next four in gold, next four in
      silver and the last four in bronze group. Another example, suppose if there are total of 14 players, the top three will
      be in platinum, next three will be in gold, next four will be silver and last four will be bronze.
